## Power Query Syntax Highlighter in Sublime Text
<br>

Power Query Advanced Editor is a great tool for writing Power Query M code. If you want to dive into the code generated by GUI, you could do it by opening this tool. For Office 365 versions of Excel, the editor also provides intellisense to write your code.

However, sometimes I still use my favorite text editor when dealing with M code especially the features like the multiple cursors, syntax higlighting, etc.

**Sublime text** is a great text editor. It's fast, flexible, extensible with packages, and with unlimited trial period (I encourage you to buy a license though). However, it does not support syntax highlighting for M code by default. Searching the Package Control repository does not show up also any existing packages to support M code syntax-highlighting.

So I decided to search in Github and found this [link](https://github.com/microsoft/DataConnectors). It contains *.tmLanguage* files for PowerQuery inside the *editors/Sublime Text folder*. 

Sublime Text 3 supports *.tmLanguage* files but the official documentation shows only how to use the *.sublime-syntax* file. I hack around the files and came up with my *.sublime-syntax*. You can download it [here](https://github.com/PowerQueryforAccountants/PowerQuerySublimeSyntax).

To use it:

1. Open Sublime Text 3 and go to **Tools > Developer > New Syntax**. 
2. Copy the *.sublime-syntax* file to the new file.
3. Save it to your packages location.

### Results
The repo contains also a sample Power Query M code. If you open the *sample.m* in Sublime Text, it should look like this

Notice how the keywords `let` and `in` are highlighted correctly. Also, `null` and `true` primitive types are differentiated quite nicely.

### Conclusion
The *.sublime-syntax* file I made is far from perfect. I've just hacked around the files and test it. If you notice some bugs, feel free to leave a comment below so I could check it.

Till then, **Stay Querious & Happy coding!**
