### Detecting Unrecorded Sales
<br>

Power Query can also be used to detect any unrecorded sales. With its powerful grouping and merge functionality, we can compare large datasets with ease. 

Let's explore this.

### Review of our Data
We have two datasets to deal with. The first one is our Shopify data and the other one is the Xero invoices. Shopify is integrated to the client's Xero account and hence Shopify invoice are "push" to Xero. 

Due to some technicalities, this integration may fail and results to unrecorded sales. In this instances, we have to record the invoices manually in Xero.

To follow along, you could download the data [here](TODO)

### Strategy: VLOOKUP on steroids
The strategy in finding these unrecorded sales is similar with the use of the good old VLOOKUP. We find a key in the Shopify Sales, match the corresponding that the key with the ones present in our Xero account and get the corresponding sales. If we can't get a corresponding sales, it only means that the Shopify sale is not recorded.

This time we use Power Query's merge feature. Couple of advantage with using this:

* Automation - we can do this repeatedly with same workbook without having to recreate VLOOKUP formulas. All we have to do is to point POwer Query to the right files.
* Preprocessing - if you have data that needs to be preprocessed first before we can make comparisons, Power Query would be a life-saver
* Minimal file size - since we're not going to use formulas, file size would be smaller
* Suitable for large datasets - this is suitable for large datasets as we're not going to use formulas. Actual datasets are also kept intact.

### Preliminaries: Reviewing our data
Let's preview our Shopify Sales first.

Open up Per Shopify.xlsx and browse the data. Focus on the the column Order. As you could you see, this column contains invoice numbers for sales. The invoice numbers are not unique as each invoice item has its own lines. For example, INV2320 is broken down into 5 lines. Each line pertains to different items included in that invoice.

Now, let's go to our Per Xero.xlsx file. The column that we want to match with the Order column in Per Shopify.xlsx is the Reference column. The Ref column also contains duplicate as each invoice item has its own line. Moreover, it has blanks too. The blanks are valid entries to the system but they are not coming from Shopify. Perhaps they are store/offline sales. We have to remove these blanks too.

In order to successfully merge the two files, we have to make sure that the columns to be match (called the 'key') has unique values. To do that, we have to group our data by they key and arrive at a total invoice amount per line.

We could easily do that with Power Query.

### Preparing our data
Let's clean first Per Shopify.xlsx. In a new workbook:
1. Go to Data > Get Data > From Workbook. Choose Per Shopify.xlx. Click on Edit.
TODO: Image

2. Remove unnecessary columns. We are only concern with Order, Billing country, "Amount (after discounts before tax)", "Taxes", "Amount (after discounts and taxes)"

3. Make sure that the Order column does not have any trailing spaces. These could throw off our Grouping later on so we have to make sure that values in this column are formatted consistently.

4. Now, let's group by the Order column. Go to Transform > Group by. Group by Order column and sum the Gross, GST, and Net Amount column.

TODO: Image

Now, let's go to our Per Xero.xlsx.
1. In the same workbook, create another query and go to the Per Xero.xlsx. Click on Edit.
2. We have to extract the Invoice number from the Reference column. Go to Transform > Extract Last Characters. Extract the last 7 characters.
3. Trim and clean this column.
4. Filter also the rows where Reference is blank or null.
5. Lastly, group our data by the Reference column. Sum the Gross, GST, and Net Amount columns.


### Merging Our Data
Now that our data we're already cleaned and group by Invoice number, we can merge them now. To determine unrecorded sales we have to get the Invoices in Shopify data that are not in the Xero data. 

In database parlance, we have to get Shopify left-anti join Xero. Visualizing in a Venn Diagram, left-anti join is the part where it says "Shopify-Only Sales"

TODO: venn

To get this
1. In the same workbook, create a merge query.
2. Choose the Shopify as the first data, Xero as the second data. Choose left-anti join
3. Click on the key that we're going to use. Basically, this will be the piece that will "stitch" this data together
4. Expand the Xero data. Include the original table headings to distinguish it from the Shopify Sales.

The resulting table will be the sales that are in Shopify but not in Xero. These are the unrecorded sales.

### Bonus: Detecting Fictitious Sales
We have determine unrecorded sales by using left-anti join. But what if we flip the order of the data that we joined. What if we choose Xero as our first data and the Shopify as the second one. What if we get Xero-only sales?

In that case, we could possibly uncover two things:
1. Fictitious sales
2. Erroneous sales tag as Shopify

Certainly, the first one would be our most concern. It has the effect of increasing sales taxes and commissions if there's any.

To get extract this, just follow the previous steps for the merge. But this time, choose Xero first and Shopify data as second and choose left-anti join.
